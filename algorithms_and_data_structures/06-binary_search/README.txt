Binary search
Implement binary search on sorted arrays.

Integrate an OpCounter to the class, to count comparisons between the search key and 
elements in the array that your code makes. Expose that functionality with the signature 
appropriate for your programming language:
Java int count(int array[], int key, int lo, int hi)
