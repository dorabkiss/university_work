Implement a dynamic array data structure, supporting the following operations:
length - return the current size of the dynamic array
select[k] - return the kth element of the dynamic array
store![o,k] set the kth element of the array to o
push![o] increase the length of the dynamic array by 1, and set the endmost element to o
pop! return the endmost element, decreasing the size of the dynamic array by 1
